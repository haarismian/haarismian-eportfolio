                <p>
                  Reflecting on this week's unit on Introduction to Operating
                  Systems, I am intrigued by the broad scope and profound
                  influence that operating systems have on both user
                  applications and system security. It's enlightening to learn
                  about how various aspects of an operating system, such as
                  processes, threads, and schedulers, operate, and how they
                  collectively contribute to the functionality of the system.
                  The security component of the unit was especially
                  enlightening, and I am now aware of the importance of properly
                  securing operating systems to safeguard against potential
                  vulnerabilities. The exploration of static and dynamic
                  libraries also provided me with a deeper understanding of how
                  applications interact with the OS. This newfound knowledge is
                  not just academic, it has practical implications and will
                  influence my approach to software development and system
                  security in the future.

            <h1>What is an ontology?</h1>
            <p>
              An ontology is like a structured map or blueprint that helps
              computers and people understand a particular topic or subject
              area. It defines the important concepts, their relationships, and
              properties within that area, making it easier for machines to work
              with and reason about the information related to that topic. It's
              like a shared language that enables different systems to
              communicate and share knowledge effectively.
            </p>
            <h1>
              Could you attempt to define an ontology that would be relevant to
              the system that you are designing for the summative assessment?
            </h1>
            <p>
              From my understanding, the entirety of the design document is an
              ontology. The document maps out the business use cases, the
              different APIs and the different actors and relationships within
              the system
            </p>

            <h1>What are the two main security vulnerabilities with your shell?</h1>
<p>The two main security vulnerabilities with the shell script are: 
    <ol>
        <li><b>Command Injection:</b> Even though this particular shell only implements four commands (LIST, ADD, HELP, EXIT), a more sophisticated shell might allow users to execute arbitrary commands. If user inputs aren't properly sanitized, this could lead to command injection attacks where malicious commands are executed.</li>
        <li><b>Lack of Authentication:</b> Currently, the shell does not implement any sort of authentication or access control. In a real-world application, this could allow unauthorized users to execute commands, potentially exposing sensitive system information or manipulating system files.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h1>What is one recommendation you would make to increase the security of the shell?</h1>
<p>A simple way to increase the security of the shell would be to implement some form of <b>authentication or access control</b>. This would prevent unauthorized users from executing commands. It would also be wise to sanitize any user input to prevent command injection attacks.</p>

<h1>Add a section to your e-portfolio that provides a (pseudo)code example of changes you would make to the shell to improve its security.</h1>
<p>Here's an example of how we might add some rudimentary authentication to our shell:
    <pre><code>
    import getpass

    USERS = {'admin': 'password'}

    def authenticate():
        username = input("Username: ")
        password = getpass.getpass("Password: ")
        if USERS.get(username) != password:
            print("Invalid credentials.")
            return False
        return True

    def cli():
        if not authenticate():
            return
        # The rest of the cli function here...
    </code></pre>
    In this code, the function `authenticate` prompts the user for a username and password before allowing them to access the shell. Note that the passwords are not stored securely in this example. In a real application, you'd want to hash and salt the passwords, and possibly use a more secure method of prompting for the password.
