                  Unit 2 of our Secure Software Development module, focused on
                  UML Modelling to support secure system planning, brings a new
                  dimension to my understanding of software security. It
                  reinforces the importance of integrating security practices
                  into every stage of the agile Software Development Life Cycle
                  (SDLC). This is a critical skill, given the growing reliance
                  on digital systems across various sectors, and the
                  corresponding increase in cybersecurity threats. The
                  opportunity to experiment with UML flow charts and understand
                  the process from a hands-on perspective not only enhances my
                  theoretical understanding but also provides me with a
                  practical skillset that is highly relevant in today's
                  tech-driven world.

                <p>
                  Moreover, the exercise of researching academic literature to
                  gain insights into agile process-driven software development
                  that prioritizes security is enriching my knowledge base,
                  which I believe will have a substantial impact on my future
                  career. It is preparing me for real-world scenarios where
                  keeping atop current research and best practices in software
                  development and security will be crucial. Additionally,
                  learning to dissect a process into constituent steps for
                  representation as a flow chart is developing my analytical and
                  problem-solving skills, both of which are key for a successful
                  career in software development. These skills will prove vital
                  not just in understanding and communicating complex systems
                  but also in identifying and mitigating potential security
                  risks. Overall, I believe this unit is significantly
                  contributing to shaping me as a well-rounded computer science
                  professional who is adept at developing secure software
                  solutions.

            <h1>Question 2</h1>
            <p>
              Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security.
              Select five terms from ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 Terms and
              Definitions and write a 300-word blog post on how people can be
              managed to overcome cyber security attacks from the inside.
            </p>
            <h1>Response</h1>
            <p>
              Cybersecurity threats can originate from within an organization,
              making people the first line of defense and, unfortunately, a
              potential vulnerability. To mitigate the risks of internal
              cybersecurity attacks, organizations must focus on effectively
              managing their human resources. In this blog post, we will explore
              five key aspects—access control, authentication, confidentiality,
              integrity, and availability—and discuss how organizations can
              manage people to overcome cybersecurity attacks from within. 1.
              Access Control: Implementing robust access control mechanisms is
              essential to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive systems and
              data. By employing principles like the "least privilege" approach
              and role-based access control (RBAC), organizations can ensure
              that individuals have access only to the resources necessary to
              perform their duties. Regular reviews of access privileges and
              prompt removal of unnecessary permissions help minimize the risk
              of insider threats.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Authentication: Authentication serves as a critical gatekeeper
              in preventing unauthorized access. By implementing strong
              authentication methods such as multi-factor authentication (MFA),
              organizations can significantly enhance the security of user
              identities. MFA combines multiple factors, such as passwords,
              biometrics, or security tokens, to provide an additional layer of
              assurance. Educating employees about the importance of strong
              authentication and enforcing secure password practices further
              strengthens the authentication process.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Confidentiality: Protecting the confidentiality of sensitive
              information is paramount. Organizations should establish clear
              guidelines regarding data handling and classification. Training
              employees on data protection measures, such as encrypting
              sensitive data and utilizing secure communication channels, helps
              prevent unauthorized disclosure. By fostering a culture of
              confidentiality and ensuring employees understand their
              responsibilities, organizations can mitigate the risk of insider
              data breaches.

              4. Integrity: Maintaining the integrity of data and systems is
              crucial to prevent unauthorized modifications or tampering.
              Organizations should enforce strict change control processes,
              ensuring that only authorized individuals can make changes. By
              implementing file integrity monitoring systems, regular
              vulnerability assessments, and robust change management
              procedures, organizations can detect and address any unauthorized
              alterations promptly.
            </p>
            <p>
              5. Availability: Ensuring the availability of critical systems and
              resources is essential. Organizations should implement redundancy
              measures, backup protocols, and disaster recovery plans to
              minimize downtime in the event of an attack. Conducting regular
              training and simulations to educate employees on incident response
              and business continuity processes helps maintain operational
              resilience.
