                  This unit, "Using Linters to Support Python Testing", has
                  indeed added an essential skill to my repertoire as a Computer
                  Science student focusing on software development. My
                  understanding of linters and their crucial role in developing
                  high-quality, error-free Python code has deepened
                  significantly. I have learned to appreciate their diverse
                  contributions in various contexts, adding a new dimension to
                  my coding and debugging techniques. I am now better equipped
                  to identify, rectify, and avoid common coding errors, which
                  significantly aids in writing consistent and efficient code.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In my journey towards becoming a competent software engineer,
                  this unit has cemented the importance of robust testing
                  practices. Understanding and applying linters is not just
                  about correcting errors; it is about proactively improving
                  code quality, readability, and maintainability. The experience
                  of comparing and contrasting the outputs from different
                  linters was particularly enlightening and showed me their
                  varying capabilities and the scenarios in which they are most
                  applicable.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The practical knowledge and hands-on experience from this unit
                  will undoubtedly contribute significantly to my career goals.
                  High-quality, secure code is a sought-after skill in the
                  software industry, and mastering it would give me an edge. Not
                  only will it aid in developing secure applications but also
                  instill a meticulous approach to code review and debugging in
                  any future projects. I look forward to applying these skills
                  in my summative assessments and in the real world, making code
                  that is not only functional but also adheres to the highest
                  quality standards.

            <p>The issues were as follows</p>
            <ol>
              <li>raw_input is used in python 2 and not 3</li>
              <li>
                the code for the decode function is nested meaning it will never
                run
              </li>
              <li>
                print encoded again uses python 2 syntax rather than 3 and this
                interpreter uses 3, this is the fixed code below:
              </li>
            </ol>
            <img

              The code was then run through the linter again and the output was
              as follows:

            <p>
              Unfortunately the rest of the questions were not able to be
              completed as codio returned errors during any package
              installation. Reaching out to Codio support was fruitless

            These linting tools vere incredibly useful in writing secure and
            maintainable code. Instead of these particular linters, our team
            used an auto pop8 styler recommended by Professor Peoples, which was
            instrumental in creating the project. Our team achieved a 87%
            testing code coverage thanks to the mix of testing and linters
