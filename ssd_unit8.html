                <p>
                  As a software engineer, this module on Cryptography and its
                  use in Operating Systems aligns perfectly with my professional
                  goals. With cyber threats and data breaches becoming
                  increasingly prevalent, understanding the principles and
                  technology behind cryptography is crucial. Through this
                  module, I will gain comprehensive knowledge about various
                  cryptographic libraries, how they can be applied to operating
                  systems, and the challenges that one might encounter during
                  this process. This knowledge will be beneficial when designing
                  and implementing secure systems, helping me ensure that the
                  software I develop is resilient against potential attacks. A
                  practical example would be working on a project that requires
                  secure data transmission; here, the encryption techniques I
                  learn would be invaluable. For example in the group project it
                  helped us select which type of database tool to use
                </p>

                <p>
                  Additionally, the hands-on experience of creating a basic
                  application using cryptographic libraries will help refine my
                  programming and problem-solving skills. It's one thing to
                  understand the theory of cryptography, but being able to apply
                  it practically to software development is an entirely
                  different ball game. Through this course, I'll have the
                  opportunity to do just that. This skill set could be used, for
                  example, in building an application that requires user
                  authentication. Leveraging my knowledge from this module, I
                  would be able to implement secure encryption for users'
                  sensitive data such as passwords, providing an additional
                  layer of security. All in all, the learning outcomes of this
                  module will equip me with vital skills that will significantly
                  enhance my capabilities as a software engineer.

            <h1>Why did you select the algorithm you chose?</h1>
            <p>
              I chose the Fernet symmetric encryption method because it is a
              strong, high-level method provided by the cryptography library in
              Python. Fernet guarantees that data encrypted using it cannot be
              further manipulated or read without the key. It uses AES for
              encryption and HMAC for authentication, providing a secure way to
              handle encryption. I have also used this system of cryptography in
              the group project as well.
            </p>

            <h1>Would it meet the GDPR regulations? Justify your answer.</h1>
            <p>
              Yes, using encryption to secure personal data is one of the
              measures suggested by GDPR to ensure the safety and integrity of
              personal data. Fernet, being a reliable and strong encryption
              algorithm, would help in fulfilling this requirement. However,
              it's important to remember that GDPR compliance is not only about
              how data is encrypted, but also about how keys are managed, how
              consent is obtained for data processing, how data subjects can
              exercise their rights, and much more.
