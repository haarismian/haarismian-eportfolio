                  <p>Unit 6 provided a comprehensive exploration of questionnaire design, a crucial tool in research data collection. It elucidated the key differences between questionnaires and surveys, highlighting the questionnaire's role as an instrument within broader survey methodologies (Ng, 2006). The unit emphasized the importance of question type selection—open versus closed—and its impact on data collection, whether quantitative, qualitative, or mixed (Fowler, 2009). Understanding common pitfalls in questionnaire design, such as leading questions and inadequate response options, and learning how to avoid them has equipped me to create more effective research instruments (Satrix Solutions, 2024). This knowledge is essential for upcoming projects where precise data collection is crucial for drawing sound research conclusions, particularly in the field of computer science where data quality directly impacts analysis outcomes (OECD, 2012).</p>

       The question asked us to:
       Think about which data collection tool will be suitable for your area of investigation (in this module and/or in your Project module). How will you collect it and what analysis would you hope to perform? How will this answer your research question? This should also be included in the presentation of your Project Proposal in Unit 10.

        <p>
 Find a questionnaire and critique the design, both the format and the questions used.

Consider areas such as ‘why is this question included?’, ‘is the form of the question appropriate?’ etc. How can you improve the questionnaire?

Put your analysis in the module wiki and comment on others’ analyses.
