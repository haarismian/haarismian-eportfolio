                  <p>Unit 6 was a deep dive into the craft of questionnaire design, a fundamental tool in data collection for research. It clarified the critical distinctions between a questionnaire and a survey, emphasizing the role of the questionnaire as an instrument within broader survey methodologies. This week, I learned the importance of question type selection—open versus closed—and the impact this has on the type of data collected, whether quantitative, qualitative, or mixed. Understanding the common pitfalls in questionnaire design and how to avoid them has prepared me to create more effective research instruments. This knowledge is crucial for my upcoming projects where precise data collection is vital for sound research conclusions.</p>

       The question asked us to:
       Think about which data collection tool will be suitable for your area of investigation (in this module and/or in your Project module). How will you collect it and what analysis would you hope to perform? How will this answer your research question? This should also be included in the presentation of your Project Proposal in Unit 10.
