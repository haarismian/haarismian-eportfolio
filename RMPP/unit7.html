                  <p>Week 7 of the course provided a comprehensive overview of validity, generalizability, and reliabilityâ€”three pillars that are fundamental to any research study. Understanding these concepts has significantly influenced my approach to research design, ensuring that the data I collect and the conclusions I draw are robust and defensible. This unit also deepened my understanding of the nuances between qualitative and quantitative data, particularly in how they are analyzed and presented. This knowledge is vital as I prepare to cleanse and validate my data before embarking on detailed analysis. I now feel better equipped to structure my research to not only answer my questions but to ensure that the findings can be confidently applied to wider contexts.</p>
