                </header>
                <p>
                  Unit 3 of my MSC course on Research Methods, I really got a
                  handle on the practical steps for conducting research. The
                  breakdown of exploratory and conclusive research designs was
                  especially useful; it clarified how each approach serves a
                  different purpose depending on what you're trying to find out.
                  By learning about qualitative, quantitative, and mixed
                  methods, I now feel better prepared to pick the right method
                  for my research questions (Creswell and Creswell, 2018). This
                  unit has directly impacted how I plan my research projects,
                  making me more thoughtful about matching my research methods
                  with my goals. It's reassuring to have these strategies in my
                  toolkit for future work.

              <h2>e-Portfolio Activity: Research Proposal Review</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
              Considering your thoughts on your chosen area of interest for your
              project: Which of the methods described in this week's reading
              would you think would suit your purpose? Which data collection
              methods would you consider using?
            </p>
            <h1>Response to research questions:</h1>
            <p>
              Please note I am completing this artefact after I finished the
              research proposal so my response is written retroactively
            </p>
            <h2>1. Suitable Research Methods:</h2>
            <p>
              Given the aims and objectives of my proposal, a
              <strong>Mixed Methods Research</strong> approach seems most
              suitable. This approach integrates both qualitative and
              quantitative methods, ideal for my project as it involves
              evaluating the quantitative aspects of detection accuracy and the
              qualitative aspects of user interactions and responses to
              interventions.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'll use <strong>Quantitative methods</strong> to statistically
              assess the accuracy of the GPT-4 model in identifying instances of
              cyberbullying, measure response effectiveness, and compare the
              performance of GPT-4 against existing solutions. This will include
              experiments designed to quantify the true positive and false
              positive rates of detection (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2017).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Qualitative methods</strong> will provide deeper insights
              into how users perceive the interventions of the GPT-4 enabled
              chatbots and how these interventions impact their experience on
              social media platforms. I plan to use interviews or focus groups
              to gather detailed responses about user satisfaction and the
              practical effects of the chatbot interventions (Denzin & Lincoln,
              2018).
            </p>

            <h2>2. Data Collection Methods:</h2>
            <p>
              For my research, I will use the following data collection methods:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Surveys and Polls</strong>: To gather broad quantitative
                data on user experiences and satisfaction levels with the GPT-4
                chatbot (Fowler, 2014).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Interviews</strong>: To collect in-depth qualitative
                insights from a selected group of users who have interacted with
                the chatbot. This will help me understand personal user
                experiences and the subjective effectiveness of the chatbot's
                interventions (Kvale, 2007).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Experiments</strong>: To conduct controlled tests
                assessing the detection capabilities and intervention success
                rates of the chatbot. This will involve scenarios where the
                chatbot is exposed to simulated social media environments to
                evaluate its performance in real-time conditions (Shadish, Cook
                & Campbell, 2002).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Observations</strong>: To monitor real-time interactions
                on social media platforms where the GPT-4 chatbot is active,
                allowing me to observe its functionality and user engagement
                directly (Angrosino, 2007).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These methods will provide crucial data that aligns with the
              different aspects of my research objectives, offering a
              comprehensive view of both the technical efficacy and user
              reception of the GPT-4 based cyberbullying mitigation strategies.
