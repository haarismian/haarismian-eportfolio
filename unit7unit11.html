              As a postgraduate level computer science student, I recently
              completed two challenging assignments that required me to design
              and implement a driverless car using Python. The experience was
              both challenging and enlightening, and I am excited to reflect on
              the valuable lessons that I learned through these assignments.
            </p>

            <p>
              First and foremost, I learned the importance of good planning. As
              the Abraham Lincoln quote goes, "Give me six hours to chop down a
              tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe." This
              quote perfectly captures the significance of spending ample time
              planning and utilizing various modeling techniques to create a
              comprehensive vision of the system in one's mind. By doing so, I
              was able to facilitate the subsequent implementation phase
              significantly.
            </p>

            <p>
              During the implementation phase, I discovered several edge cases
              that I hadn't considered during the planning phase. However,
              having a solid plan and an excellent understanding of different
              modeling techniques enabled me to address these challenges
              effectively. I came to appreciate the value of various modeling
              techniques and how they significantly facilitate the coding
              process, similar to how writing an outline for an essay helps in
              writing the essay itself.
            </p>

            <p>
              Moreover, I learned through the planning phase that it is easier
              to visualize systems than to write them out. By visualizing the
              system using different modeling techniques, I was able to gain a
              much better understanding of the system's components, which made
              coding much easier.
            </p>

            <p>
              The assignments also highlighted the challenges of scaling
              implementations. For instance, the sensor class was easy to
              design, but scaling it to accommodate different types of sensors
              during implementation was much harder. Additionally, I learned the
              value of test cases, which are essential in ensuring that
              implementations are rigorously tested and free of errors. Going
              forward, I will aim to incorporate test cases into my
              implementation plans.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through these assignments, I also got the chance to develop my
              skills in OOP, learn different data structures, and algorithms.
              This experience will undoubtedly prove valuable in my future
              endeavors as a software engineer.
            </p>

            <p>
              Regarding how I would implement the lessons I learned in my
              professional life, I would prioritize planning and visualization,
              utilizing various modeling techniques to create a comprehensive
              understanding of the system. Additionally, I would incorporate
              test cases into my implementation plans to ensure that
              implementations are thoroughly tested and free of errors.
            </p>

            <p>
              If I had more time to work on these assignments, I would focus on
              implementing advanced decision-making algorithms that factor in
              road conditions, weather, and traffic patterns. Additionally, I
              would explore integrating interfaces for human interaction and
              control, allowing passengers to give commands and override the
              car's decisions in certain situations.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, the experience of designing and implementing a
              driverless car using Python was both challenging and enlightening.
              Through the assignments, I learned the importance of good
              planning, the value of various modeling techniques, the challenges
              of scaling implementations, and the significance of test cases. I
              am excited to apply these lessons in my future endeavors and
              continue developing my skills in OOP, data structures, and
              algorithms.
