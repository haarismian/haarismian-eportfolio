              The paper provides some information on the strengths of taking a
              metamodel approach to support object-oriented design of the
              Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Specifically, the use of
              metamodels can help to model IoT system properties at different
              levels of abstraction. At the analysis phase, metamodels can be
              used to abstract the main entities of the IoT system (such as
              human/digital users and smart objects), their basic features, and
              high-level interactions. This can help to provide a common
              understanding among stakeholders about the system being developed.
              At the design phase, metamodels can be used to define more
              detailed aspects of the system, such as its architecture and
              communication protocols. This can help to ensure that all
              components of the system are designed in a consistent manner. At
              the implementation phase, metamodels can be used to generate code
              automatically or semi-automatically based on the models created in
              earlier phases. This can help to reduce errors and improve
              efficiency in coding.

              One potential weakness of taking a metamodel approach for IoT
              systems, as mentioned in the PDF file, is the risk of
              over-engineering and creating overly complex models that are
              difficult to understand and maintain. The article suggests that
              this risk can be mitigated by using a modular approach to
              metamodel development. Specifically, the proposed approach defines
              three levels of SO metamodels, respectively linked to the
              analysis, design, and implementation phases of development. Each
              level is designed to be modular and reusable across different
              projects. By using a modular approach to metamodel development,
              the article suggests that it is possible to avoid over-engineering
              and create models that are easier to understand and maintain. This
              is because each module can be developed independently and tested
              separately before being integrated into the larger system.
              However, it is important to note that even with a modular
              approach, there is still a risk of creating overly complex models
              if they are not designed carefully. Therefore, it is important for
              developers to strike a balance between creating models that are
              detailed enough to support the development process but not so
              complex that they become difficult to manage.
