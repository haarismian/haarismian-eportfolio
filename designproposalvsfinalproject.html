            <h1>Comparative Analysis of Design Document and Final Project</h1>
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
              The purpose of this analysis is to examine the changes that
              happened in the development process, how and why they occurred,
              and to explain how such modifications are typical in the software
              development lifecycle.
            </p>
            <h2>1. Frontend Development</h2>
            <p>
              Initially, the design document specified the use of React for
              frontend development. React is a popular JavaScript library for
              building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
              However, during the development phase, the team switched to Django
              templates, which use a syntax the team was more familiar with,
              HTML. Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages
              rapid development and clean, pragmatic design (Django, 2023). This
              switch can be attributed to a common phenomenon in software
              development where the chosen technology stack may change based on
              the team's expertise and familiarity with the tools.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Database Systems</h2>
            <p>
              The design document indicated the use of PostgreSQL as the
              database system. PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source
              object-relational database system with over 30 years of active
              development that has earned it a strong reputation for
              reliability, feature robustness, and performance (PostgreSQL,
              2023). However, during the development, the team decided to use
              SQLite databases. This switch was likely due to SQLite's
              simplicity and ease of setup compared to PostgreSQL. SQLite
              databases are serverless and self-contained, which can be
              beneficial for development and testing environments (SQLite,
              2023). To ensure the security of data, the team utilized the
              Django-Cryptography package, which uses Fernet algorithms for
              encrypting the SQLite databases.
            </p>
            <h2>3. Inter-Service Communication</h2>
            <p>
              Originally, the design document proposed the use of a messaging
              queue for inter-service communication. However, in the final
              implementation, the application communicated between services
              using RESTful API calls. This change could have been due to the
              increased complexity of implementing a messaging queue or the
              additional overhead it may add to the system. RESTful APIs provide
              a straightforward and efficient way for services to communicate
              with each other, and they are widely used in web development
              (Fielding and Taylor, 2002).
            </p>
            <h2>4. Deployment</h2>
            <p>
              The design document specified that the application would be
              deployed remotely. However, due to the complexity of deployment
              and the time constraint, the team decided to deploy the
              application locally. This change is not uncommon in software
              development, particularly in projects with tight deadlines or
              where the primary aim is to validate functionality rather than
              assess performance at scale.
            </p>
            <h2>5. Monitoring</h2>
            <p>
              Initially, AWS CloudWatch was to be used for monitoring according
              to the design document. However, due to the application being
              deployed locally, Django's built-in logger was used instead. AWS
              CloudWatch is a comprehensive monitoring service for AWS resources
              and applications, while Django's logger allows for the collection
              of system logs, information about server errors, and more (AWS,
              2023; Django, 2023). The choice of monitoring tool often depends
              on the deployment environment, and in this case, a local
              deployment favored the use of Django's built-in logger.
            </p>
            <h2>6. Business and Non-Functional Requirements</h2>
            <p>
              Despite these changes, the team was able to successfully implement
              all business and non-functional requirements. This outcome shows
              that while the technology stack and deployment methods may have
              changed, the core functionality and performance requirements of
              the software remained consistent with the original design
              document.
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              In conclusion, the changes observed in the development of the
              software system for the Dutch National Cybersecurity Centre
              demonstrate that software design is a dynamic process. Design
              documents serve as blueprints, but they often evolve based on
              project constraints, the development team's expertise, and other
              factors (Parnas and Clements, 1986).
